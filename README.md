In this project I  created a basic calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator in such a way that a functional 
calculator can perform arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. By completing this project my  front-end development skills are developed and enhanced my  understanding of web technologies.
